<p>The attributes used for prediction are: </br>
1. Glucose</br>
2. Pregnancies </br>
3. Diabetes Pedigree Value</br>
4. BMI </br></br></p>

<h2> Glucose </h2>
<p>The process for calculating glucose levels using a glucometer typically involves the following steps:</br></br></p><div>

<div class="tax"><p>
<b>*</b> Wash your hands with soap and warm water to ensure they are clean and free from any residue that could affect the accuracy of the reading.</br>

<b>*</b> Insert a test strip into the glucometer according to the manufacturer's instructions.</br>

<b>*</b> Use a lancing device to prick the side of your fingertip. You may also use an alternate site such as your forearm or palm, depending on the instructions &nbsp &nbspprovided by your healthcare provider.</br>

<b>*</b> Squeeze your finger gently to produce a small drop of blood and place it on the end of the test strip.</br>

<b>*</b> Wait for the glucometer to display your blood glucose reading. The amount of time this takes will depend on the specific glucometer model you are &nbsp&nbsp&nbspusing.</br>

<b>*</b> Record your blood glucose reading in a logbook or digital device, along with the date and time of the test.</br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt's important to note that the process for calculating glucose levels using a glucometer may vary slightly depending on the specific model you are &nbsp&nbsp&nbspusing.Always follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully and consult with your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns.</br>

<h2> Diabetes Pedigree Value</h2>
 <p> 
A diabetes pedigree is a tool used by healthcare providers to assess the risk of developing diabetes in individuals who have a family history of the disease. The pedigree value is a number assigned to each family member based on their relationship to the proband (the person who is the focus of the pedigree). </br>
Diabetes pedigree Calculator is available in our system, just enter number of relatives effected by diabetes in consideration of corresponding relation with them.</br> 
 </p> 


</br></br>

<h2> BMI </h2>
 <p> BMI stands for Body Mass Index and is a measure of a person's body fat based on their weight and height. It is commonly used as a screening tool to identify whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.</br>
Diabetes pedigree Calculator is available in our system, just enter the height in cm and weight in kg.</br>
