<h1><center> Diabetes</center></h1>
<p>
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose), which is the primary source of energy for your cells. When you eat food, your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose, which then enters your bloodstream. In response, your pancreas produces a hormone called insulin, which helps your cells absorb and use the glucose for energy.</br>

In people with diabetes, however, the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or doesn't use it effectively, leading to high levels of glucose in the bloodstream. This can cause a variety of health problems over time, including damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and cardiovascular system.
</br>
There are two main types of diabetes:
</br>
* Type 1 diabetes, which is typically diagnosed in children and young adults and occurs when the body doesn't produce enough insulin. This type of diabetes requires daily insulin injections or the use of an insulin pump to regulate blood sugar levels.
</br>
* Type 2 diabetes, which is the most common form of diabetes and occurs when the body doesn't use insulin properly. This type of diabetes can often be managed with lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, and may also require medication or insulin therapy.
</br>
There are also other forms of diabetes, such as gestational diabetes (which occurs during pregnancy) and rare genetic forms of diabetes.</p>
